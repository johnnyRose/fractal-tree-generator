# fractal-tree-generator
Generate trees with fractal patterns

TODO:

- ~~add "droop" per level, should basically just rotate non-vertical branches "down" X degrees~~
- tree "rounding" - branches closer to the tip of the branch typically have a steeper incline (and are also typically smaller)
- ~~sharing feature with URL parameters~~
- add variance to variables
- explain fields
- input validation
